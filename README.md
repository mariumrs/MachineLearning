### Data visualization [Oct 2024]
#### Introduction 
In this unit, I explored the critical role of data visualization in analyzing large datasets to enhance understanding of business challenges and inform decision-making processes. Data visualization serves as a universal language, enabling viewers to uncover patterns and relationships within data, thus facilitating effective communication of business issues both internally and externally.

#### Expected Learning outcmes: 
- Learn fundementals of visualizations
- Learn how to effectively visualize data
- Engage in self reflection

 #### How Iâ€™ve applied these concepts in practice

The activities paired with self reflection really made me aware of where I stood in terms of my own development 

### Unit 1-2 
Learned objectives:
- Focused on understanding the fundamentals of idioms and grammer by participating in a collaborative discussion. 
- The comparison done by my peers hekped me expand my learning to see different perspectives.

### Unit 3 
Learned Objectives : 
- Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.
- Understanding how how the change in data points impacts correlation and regression.

#### Pearson's correlation 
The following results are what was observed when we changed the variable values.

##### No Noise

Output:

When we eliminate the noise, we are looking at a perfect one to one relationship in which every point falls neatly into place, forming a straight line which makes the Pearson correlation hit the max 1.0000.

##### Less Noise 

Code:

Output:

Adding a bit of noise, that perfect line will start to wobble slightly. The connection is still very strong and the correlation stays high around 0.9 to 0.99.

##### High Noise 

Code:

Output:

When throwing in a lot of noise, things start to fall apart. The link between the two variables weakens, the correlation drops and the scatterplot starts to look like a cloud than a line. It is harder to spot any clear trend.

#### Unit 5 
Learned Objectives:
