## Projects
Here is a summary of all the details of my Machine Learning project so far!

### Machine Learning [Jan 2025]
#### Introduction 
In this unit, I delved into the evolving landscape of machine learning and its significance in deriving insights from complex data. Through hands-on experience and theoretical exploration, I developed an understanding of how algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns, make predictions, and support data-driven strategies. Machine learning emerged not just as a technical skillset, but as a practical tool for solving real-world problems transforming raw information into actionable intelligence across diverse business contexts.

#### Expected Learning outcmes: 
- Understand the fundamentals of machine learning concepts and algorithms
- Learn how to apply machine learning techniques to real-world datasets
- Develop the ability to critically evaluate model performance and outcomes
- Engage in self-reflection on the ethical and practical implications of machine learning

#### How Iâ€™ve applied these concepts in practice

The activities paired with self reflection really made me aware of where I stood in terms of my personal development.

### Unit 1-2 
Learned objectives:
- Focused on understanding the fundamentals of idioms and grammer by participating in a collaborative discussion. 
- The comparison done by my peers hekped me expand my learning to see different perspectives.

### Unit 3 
Learned Objectives : 
- Understanding how how the change in data points impacts correlation and regression.

#### Pearson's correlation 
The following results are what was observed when we changed the variable values.

##### No Noise
Code:
![no noise code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b80760e7-79c5-45b0-baa7-3f6d04250740)

Output:
![no noise output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efff2288-cd23-4c7a-bf41-fb3380cad8fb)


When we eliminate the noise, we are looking at a perfect one to one relationship in which every point falls neatly into place, forming a straight line which makes the Pearson correlation hit the max 1.0000.

##### Less Noise 

Code:
![small noise code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddee93cf-1a1d-414d-9d9e-94e07b668ea9)

Output:
![small noise output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ed5904-e4eb-4887-8384-40c18241b420)

Adding a bit of noise, that perfect line will start to wobble slightly. The connection is still very strong and the correlation stays high around 0.9 to 0.99.

##### High Noise 

Code:
![high noise code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ba60a13-5f94-4fdb-a392-c0e521882eef)

Output:
![high noise](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81ca37ce-9bce-46fd-93df-3aea87e6c83a)

When throwing in a lot of noise, things start to fall apart. The link between the two variables weakens, the correlation drops and the scatterplot starts to look like a cloud than a line. It is harder to spot any clear trend.

#### Unit 5 
Learned Objectives:
